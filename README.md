# Modern C++ Concurrency - Udemy Course

This repository contains my exercises from the Udemy course ["Learn Multithreading with Modern C++"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-modern-cplusplus-concurrency/).

## Course Overview

This course, taught by James Raynard, provides an in-depth look at multithreading and concurrency in modern C++. It covers a range of topics from basic thread management to advanced concurrency patterns using C++17 and later standards.

## Repository Structure

- `section-#/` : Source codes related to section #. 

## Getting Started

You will need a modern C++ compiler, such as `g++` or `clang++` to run the source codes.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
- A modern C++ compiler (C++17 or later).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fbgonzaga/course-multithread_cpp.git
    cd course-multithread_cpp
    ```

2. Compile an example:
    ```bash
    cd section-#/
    g++ -std=c++17 sourcecode1.cpp -o sourcecode1
    ./sourcecode1
    ```

## Topics Covered

- How to write portable multi-threaded code in C++
- Understanding of concurrency
- Basic principles of multi-threading which will be applicable in all languages
- Knowledge of C++17 parallel algorithms
